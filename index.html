        <p>Christmas in South Korea is a unique blend of Western tradition and Korean culture.</p>
        <p>As the only East Asian country that recognizes Christmas (Sung Tan Jul) as a national holiday, 
           South Korea embraces the festive spirit with enthusiasm. Unlike the family-centered celebrations common in the West,
           Christmas in Korea is often seen as a romantic occasion,similar to Valentine’s Day,where couples go on dates,exchange gifts,
           and enjoy special dinners.</p>
        <p>Cities like Seoul transform into dazzling winter wonderlands, especially in shopping districts such as Myeongdong and Gangnam,
            with Christmas trees, LED displays, and themed pop-up events.The holiday is highly commercialized,with stores offering major sales
            and restaurants crafting seasonal menus, while the religious aspect is less prominent for most.</p>
            However, for the Christian minority—around 30% of the population—church services and carol singing remain meaningful traditions during this time.<br>
