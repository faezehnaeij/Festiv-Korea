        <p>Christmas in South Korea is a unique blend of Western tradition and Korean culture.<br>
             As the only East Asian country that recognizes Christmas (Sung Tan Jul) as a national holiday, <br>
             South Korea embraces the festive spirit with enthusiasm. Unlike the family-centered celebrations common in the West,<br>
             Christmas in Korea is often seen as a romantic occasion,similar to Valentine’s Day,where couples go on dates,exchange gifts,<br>
             and enjoy special dinners.<br>
             Cities like Seoul transform into dazzling winter wonderlands, especially in shopping districts such as Myeongdong and Gangnam,<br>
             with Christmas trees, LED displays, and themed pop-up events.The holiday is highly commercialized,with stores offering major sales<br>
             and restaurants crafting seasonal menus, while the religious aspect is less prominent for most.<br>
             However, for the Christian minority—around 30% of the population—church services and carol singing remain meaningful traditions during this time.<br>
